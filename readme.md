# Note App

A simple Note App that allows users to add, edit, and delete notes. Users can either click the "Ajouter" button or press the "Enter" key to add a note. The app is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

- Add a new note using the input field and the "Ajouter" button or by pressing the "Enter" key.
- Each note has two actions: **Edit** and **Delete**.
  - **Edit**: Allows the user to modify the content of the note.
  - **Delete**: Removes the note from the list.
- Notes are displayed in a simple, responsive layout.
- Clean, minimalistic UI with green for the "Add" button, blue for "Edit", and red for "Delete."
